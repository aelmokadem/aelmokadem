This world is overseen by “The Savior,” sent by the Deity to save the remaining humans from their fate and eradicate evil from the world. Sol, like the other obedient servants of the deity, worked tirelessly, awaiting his reward in the “Houses of Rest.” But then came the dream… A strange dream that turned his life upside down and set Sol on the path of his journey into the unknown world beyond the city borders to discover his true self and the truth about “The Dreamers.” This fantasy novel raises many important questions that come to life in Sol’s adventurous journey and the choices he makes. What is reality? Is it separate from our selves or deeply connected to them? What is truth and what is falsehood? When do we become free, and when do we turn into mere slaves? And where do the boundaries of humanity lie?\n\n\n\n\n\n16 Mar 2025\n\n\nAhmed Elmokadem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumbers that Dazzled the World\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNUMBERS\n\n\nPHILOSOPHY\n\n\nMATH\n\n\nHISTORY\n\n\n\nThis book takes readers on a captivating journey through the history and significance of extraordinary numbers that have shaped human thought and understanding.

    "text": "The Anti-Vax Movement: Lysenkoism’s Brain-Dead Cousin\nFast forward to the modern era, and it seems that we, as a species, have learned absolutely nothing. As I followed in horrified amazement the progress of the anti-vax—and more generally the anti-science—movement, and how mainstream political figures are pushing the anti-vax narrative, I kept being reminded of Lysenkoism and how these movements are actually the same. The sheer audacity required to reject centuries of scientific progress in favor of YouTube conspiracy theories is truly something to behold. It begs the question: what could possibly motivate people to turn their backs on one of the most significant human advancements in medical history, putting themselves, their loved ones, and their whole communities in harm’s way for absolutely no reason? Well, I believe I have reached a reasonable, albeit simple, conclusion: stupidity. I’m not referring to stupidity as the inherent lack of intelligence in individuals—so no need to take offense! Instead, I’m discussing stupidity as a social phenomenon, a collective behavior or pattern that emerges in certain contexts. But before I delve deeper into this profound revelation, let’s first take a quick tour through the history of vaccines and how they have helped humanity. This will provide some perspective on the irrationality of the anti-vax movement."

    "section": "The Historical Progress and Impact of Vaccines",
    "text": "The Historical Progress and Impact of Vaccines\nThe journey of vaccines began with Edward Jenner’s smallpox vaccine in 1796, which laid the foundation for modern immunology. Jenner’s groundbreaking discovery demonstrated that exposure to cowpox could confer immunity to smallpox, leading to the development of the first successful vaccine. Fun fact: The word “vaccine” comes from the Latin word for cow, “vacca,” as a tribute to the first cowpox-based vaccine. This concept of inducing immunity through controlled exposure to a pathogen revolutionized medicine and set the stage for future vaccines [3, 4].\nThroughout the 19th and 20th centuries, vaccine development advanced rapidly. Louis Pasteur developed vaccines for rabies and anthrax, while the 20th century saw the introduction of vaccines for diseases like diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and tuberculosis. The mid-20th century was a golden era of vaccine breakthroughs, with the polio vaccine developed by Jonas Salk in 1955 and later improved by Albert Sabin’s oral polio vaccine. These vaccines played a crucial role in nearly eradicating polio globally [3, 4].\nTo put this into perspective, global immunization efforts have saved at least 154 million lives over the past 50 years. The measles vaccine alone has saved nearly 94 million lives since 1974. Thanks to the polio vaccine, more than 20 million people are able to walk today who would otherwise have been paralyzed. Smallpox, once a deadly disease that killed 300 million people in the 20th century alone, was eradicated in 1980 due to a successful global vaccination campaign [3, 4]. Feel free to take a moment to marvel at these numbers, which only a handful of human inventions can rival.\nThen why on Earth did some people choose to steer away from such a successful history?"

    "text": "It Runs Deep\nThe anti-vax sentiment has always gone hand-in-hand with vaccines. A stark example of the manifestation of such sentiment was the formation of the “London Society for the Abolition of Compulsory Vaccination” in the UK in 1880 Figure 2. This organization spread misinformation on vaccines, leading to significantly lower vaccination rates, which in turn caused outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases like smallpox [5, 6].\n\n5. contributors W (2025) Anti-vaccine activism\n\n6.

These include inherent mistrust in authority and personal beliefs or philosophies. Other, less ridiculous, reasons may include concerns about safety, which can be easily dispelled by any reasonable person, and historical medical scandals, such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study that left a lasting impact on public trust in medical institutions and public health initiatives [7]. While I can sympathize with people who were damaged by such experiences to be hesitant of vaccines, I don’t think an extreme position helps, especially since medical research has undergone many ethical reforms associated with full transparency to stop things like that from ever happening again.\n\n7.

Trust N (2025) Vaccination coverage for children and mothers\nEven with this history of vaccine hesitancy, we still managed to maintain very reasonable global vaccination rates. However, this seems to have changed with the turn of the century. For example, the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccination rates in children in the UK were around 91% between 1994-1997 [8]. That dropped significantly to about 80% by 2003 [8]. So, what happened?"

    "text": "The Wakefield Paper: Unveiling the Deception\nAh, the infamous Wakefield paper. In 1998, Andrew Wakefield published a paper in The Lancet claiming a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. This paper was later found to be fraudulent, with Wakefield manipulating data and having undisclosed conflicts of interest [9, 10].\nLet’s dive into the juicy details. Wakefield’s study was based on a whopping sample size of… twelve children. Yes, you read that right. Twelve. And these weren’t just any children; they were handpicked to fit his narrative. The study had no control group (children who did not receive the MMR vaccine), relied heavily on parental recall (because memories are always reliable, right?), and linked two common conditions (colitis and autism) without any solid evidence [9, 10].\nBut wait, there’s more! Wakefield had financial motives too. He was involved in a lawsuit against vaccine manufacturers and had a patent for a rival vaccine. Talk about a conflict of interest. He even stood to make millions from selling diagnostic kits for a non-existent syndrome he claimed to have discovered.\nAs a result of all this, the paper was retracted in 2010, and Wakefield was stripped of his medical license [9, 10]. Since the release of this bloody paper, numerous studies have been carried out and not one supported its conclusions. On the contrary, all of these papers had the exact opposite conclusion: there is absolutely no correlation between the MMR vaccine and autism!\n\n9. Fiona Godlee Jane Smith, Marcovitch H (2011) Wakefield’s article linking MMR vaccine and autism was fraudulent. BMJ\n\n10. contributors W (2023) Lancet MMR autism fraud. Wikipedia\n\n11. Hviid A, Hansen JV, Frisch M, Melbye M (2019) Measles, mumps, rubella vaccination and autism. Annals of Internal Medicine 170(8):513–520. https://doi.org/10.7326/M18-2101\nOne of these studies, published in 2019, was carried out in Denmark [11]. This study was one of the largest and most comprehensive studies to investigate the link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Researchers analyzed data from 657,461 children born between 1999 and 2010, following them from age one until August 2013. The study found no increased risk of autism in children who received the MMR vaccine compared to those who did not.\nPretty conclusive, right?! Well, not for anti-vaxxers who had already guzzled the Wakefield Kool-Aid. The damage was done!"

    "section": "Anti-Vax Greatest Hits",
    "text": "Anti-Vax Greatest Hits\nDespite the overwhelming evidence, anti-vaxxers continue to cling to several myths. So, let’s knock these down one at a time, shall we?\n\nVaccines contain harmful ingredients:\n\nThimerosal: Thimerosal is a mercury-based preservative that was used in some vaccines. However, extensive research has shown that thimerosal is safe and does not cause autism. Moreover, thimerosal has been removed or reduced to trace amounts in all childhood vaccines since 2001 [12].\nAluminum: Aluminum is used as an adjuvant in vaccines to enhance the immune response. The amount of aluminum in vaccines is minimal and well within safety limits. Studies have shown that the aluminum exposure from vaccines is much lower than what infants receive from their diet [13].\nFormaldehyde: The amount of formaldehyde in vaccines is much lower than what is naturally found in the human body and is not harmful [14].\n\nToo many shots/antigens in a short time: Some argue that the current vaccine schedule overwhelms a child’s immune system. However, scientific evidence shows that children’s immune systems can handle multiple vaccines at once. The number of antigens children are exposed to through vaccines is much lower than what they encounter daily through natural exposure [15].\nNatural Immunity is Better: Some anti-vaxxers argue that natural immunity from contracting a disease is better than vaccine-induced immunity. While natural immunity can be strong, it comes with the risk of severe illness, complications, and even death. Vaccines provide a safe way to develop immunity without these risks [16].\nVaccines Cause Autoimmune Diseases: There is a claim that vaccines can trigger autoimmune diseases. However, extensive research has shown no link between vaccines and autoimmune diseases. The benefits of vaccination far outweigh the minimal risks [17].\nVaccines Are Not Effective: Some argue that vaccines do not work and that vaccinated individuals still get sick. Tell that to smallpox, which was eradicated thanks to vaccines. No vaccine is 100% effective, but honestly, what is? Seat belts and helmets aren’t 100% effective either, yet we happily use them because we’re reasonable people trying to prevent serious injuries, even by a tiny bit. Even if you end up getting sick, vaccines significantly reduce the risk of spreading diseases, supporting herd immunity that helps protect those who cannot be vaccinated [3, 4].\nPharmaceutical Companies Profit from Vaccines: There is a belief that vaccines are pushed by pharmaceutical companies for profit. While companies do profit from vaccines, the primary goal of vaccination programs is public health. Vaccines save millions of lives and prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Also, don’t forget that numerous respectable scientists are involved in the process of vaccine productions. These are just people who have families that they too want to protect, which can only happen if the whole community is well protected by effective and safe vaccines.\nAutism Cases are on the Rise: Anti-vaxxers often point to the rising prevalence of autism as evidence that vaccines are to blame. However, the increase in autism diagnoses is largely due to better awareness, improved diagnostic criteria, and broader definitions of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [18, 19]. In other words, we’re getting better at recognizing and diagnosing autism, not causing it. As we mentioned earlier, numerous studies have shown no link between vaccines and autism [20]. So, while autism diagnoses are indeed on the rise, vaccines are not the culprit.\n\n\n12. Disease Control C for, Prevention (2023) Thimerosal in vaccines\n\n13.

For instance, measles cases have spiked globally, with outbreaks in regions where vaccination rates have dropped. The World Health Organization has listed vaccine hesitancy as one of the top threats to global health [21].\n\n21. World Health Organization (2015) Vaccine hesitancy: A growing challenge for immunization programmes\nThe consequences of the anti-vax movement are dire. Unvaccinated individuals are at a higher risk of contracting and spreading diseases, leading to preventable illnesses and deaths. In some areas, previously eradicated diseases are making a comeback, putting vulnerable populations, such as infants and immunocompromised individuals, at risk [21]."

    "text": "The Theory of Stupidity: Connecting the Dots\nThe “Theory of Stupidity,” developed by German theologian and philosopher Dietrich Bonhoeffer, provides a framework for understanding the persistence and danger of movements like Lysenkoism and the anti-vax movement. Bonhoeffer argued that stupidity is more dangerous than evil because it can be manipulated and used by evil forces, and it often goes hand-in-hand with power [22, 23].\nBonhoeffer’s theory considers stupidity not just an intellectual deficiency but a sociological problem. He argues that stupidity can spread like a contagion, especially during times of rising power and influence. One key aspect of Bonhoeffer’s theory is that stupidity is resistant to reason and facts. When confronted with evidence that contradicts their beliefs, people entrenched in stupidity dismiss it outright. This makes them particularly dangerous because they become self-satisfied and hostile when challenged. Sound familiar?\nThe anti-vax movement is a modern manifestation of this principle. It thrives on misinformation, paranoia, and a deep distrust of expertise. Instead of Soviet propaganda, we now have social media algorithms amplifying nonsense at an unprecedented scale. The result? Parents refusing to vaccinate their kids because they believe in medical fairy tales spun by influencers with no medical training. It’s like Lysenkoism all over again—except this time, instead of Stalinist repression, we have the tyranny of viral stupidity [22, 23].\n\n22. Thomson J (2023) Bonhoeffer’s theory of stupidity.

    "text": "Conclusion\nLet’s be clear: the evidence is overwhelming and irrefutable—vaccines save lives. Yet, despite all the scientific proof, anti-vaxxers cling to their misguided beliefs, putting everyone at risk. If you choose not to vaccinate your child and they end up sick, or worse, dead, that’s on you. And if your unvaccinated child infects someone else, especially a vulnerable person like an infant or someone with a compromised immune system, then their suffering and potential death are YOUR FAULT. This isn’t just about personal choice; it’s about public responsibility. Ignorance and stubbornness in the face of clear evidence aren’t just foolish—they’re dangerous.\nAnd so, here we are, in a world where medical science has handed us the tools to prevent disease, yet we’re still battling outbreaks fueled by willful ignorance. If history has taught us anything, it’s that rejecting science in favor of ideological nonsense always ends in disaster. But hey, at least Lysenko didn’t have a YouTube channel to amplify his pseudoscience even further."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A recent claim has circulated suggesting that the government spent $8 million on “transgender animal experiments,” implying that there are efforts to, as dramatically put, “make mice transgender.” This assertion, which sounds like it was pulled straight from a bad sci-fi movie, has predictably sparked outrage and confusion. Some sources have even doubled down on the narrative, citing a list of studies under sensationalized headlines. But before jumping to conclusions, let’s take a step back and unpack this claim with the seriousness it deserves (which is to say, not much at all).\nThe claim hinges on the idea that federal research funding has supported experiments to make animals transgender. Cue the outrage, the memes, and the inevitable media segments. But here’s the thing: the truth is far less exciting - and far more scientific - than these dramatic portrayals suggest.\nThe so-called “transgender animal experiments” are actually research studies focused on understanding the effects of hormone therapies. These studies examine how hormone treatments impact health conditions like HIV, cancer, and asthma. Instead of, say, giving mice tiny gender-affirming surgeries (which would be both ridiculous and logistically impossible), these studies explore how medical treatments influence biological processes. Shocking, right?"

    "text": "A recent claim has circulated suggesting that the government spent $8 million on “transgender animal experiments,” implying that there are efforts to, as dramatically put, “make mice transgender.” This assertion, which sounds like it was pulled straight from a bad sci-fi movie, has predictably sparked outrage and confusion. Some sources have even doubled down on the narrative, citing a list of studies under sensationalized headlines. But before jumping to conclusions, let’s take a step back and unpack this claim with the seriousness it deserves (which is to say, not much at all).\nThe claim hinges on the idea that federal research funding has supported experiments to make animals transgender. Cue the outrage, the memes, and the inevitable media segments. But here’s the thing: the truth is far less exciting - and far more scientific - than these dramatic portrayals suggest.\nThe so-called “transgender animal experiments” are actually research studies focused on understanding the effects of hormone therapies. These studies examine how hormone treatments impact health conditions like HIV, cancer, and asthma. Instead of, say, giving mice tiny gender-affirming surgeries (which would be both ridiculous and logistically impossible), these studies explore how medical treatments influence biological processes. Shocking, right?"

By deliberately misrepresenting legitimate research as political overreach, critics undermine medical progress that benefits all populations. This approach carries troubling parallels to historical resistance against studying women’s health - a bias that persisted until federal mandates required their inclusion in clinical trials [7].\nThe transphobic subtext - that transgender lives are unworthy of scientific study - threatens to recreate the same exclusionary practices that have long distorted medical knowledge. When research excludes any population, the resulting gaps in understanding ultimately harm everyone who might benefit from that science."

    "section": "The Bone That Changed Math",
    "text": "The Bone That Changed Math\nWhat truly set humans apart was not this innate numerical sense, but rather our ability to transform it into systematic counting. This cognitive revolution occurred with the invention of tally sticks—carefully crafted bone artifacts bearing sequences of incised markings. These ancient tools represented a quantum leap in human thinking. Unlike other animals limited to immediate quantity recognition in their environment, these physical counting devices enabled prehistoric humans to record, track, and manipulate numbers beyond the present moment. They could now keep count over time, compare quantities from different occasions, and even perform basic operations. This breakthrough laid the essential foundation for all subsequent mathematical development, establishing the mental framework that would eventually lead to modern mathematics [2].\nAmong the most fascinating of these ancient counting tools is the Ishango Bone, discovered in 1960 in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. This remarkable artifact, dating back approximately 20,000 years BCE [3], consists of a baboon’s fibula bearing a series of carefully made markings arranged in distinct columns. While scholars continue to debate its exact purpose—with theories ranging from tracking lunar cycles to recording hunting yields or seasonal changes—what remains undeniable is that each incision systematically represents the concept of “one,” with groupings of these marks representing larger quantities. This demonstrates an early understanding of one-to-one correspondence, a fundamental mathematical principle.\nThe Ishango Bone was not an isolated development. Archaeologists have discovered even older tally sticks that push back the origins of human counting. A notable example comes from Swaziland, dating to about 37,000 years BCE, while another significant specimen was found in Czechoslovakia, originating from approximately 32,000 years BCE. What makes the Ishango Bone particularly noteworthy among these ancient artifacts are the specific numerical patterns evident in its markings. The bone displays groupings of marks that correspond to the numbers 11, 13, 17, and 19—which happen to be precisely the prime numbers between 10 and 20. These special numbers, divisible only by themselves and \\(1\\), hold a unique position in mathematics as the fundamental building blocks of all natural numbers through multiplication. The apparent organization of these primes on the Ishango Bone suggests its creators may have recognized these numerical relationships, implying a surprisingly advanced understanding of mathematical concepts for such an early period. However, this interpretation remains controversial in the scientific community, with many researchers maintaining that these prime number groupings could simply be coincidental [4]. This ongoing debate highlights both the sophistication of early human cognition and the challenges inherent in interpreting ancient artifacts through modern mathematical frameworks.\n\n4.

    "section": "From Clay Tokens to Computers",
    "text": "From Clay Tokens to Computers\nThe next major revolution in numerical thinking came with the Sumerians of Mesopotamia, who achieved a profound conceptual breakthrough by liberating \\(1\\) from physical tally marks. Their ingenious innovation took the form of small clay cones, each representing an abstract unit of “one” [5]. This development marked humanity’s first step toward truly symbolic mathematics—no longer requiring physical marks or notches, a single clay token could now represent any single quantity. This abstraction allowed for much more flexible and powerful mathematical operations.\nThese portable clay tokens enabled far more than simple counting—they made possible genuine calculation. Archaeological evidence clearly shows that the Sumerians used these tokens to perform the earliest known addition and subtraction operations in human history. This raises a fundamental question about the origins of mathematics: why did this systematic numerical thinking emerge in Sumerian society when many other cultures, such as certain isolated tribes in the Amazon and Australia, have existed for millennia with only the most basic numerical concepts—often just words for “one” and “many”—and no developed mathematics? The answer appears to lie in the revolutionary development of urban civilization. As the world’s first cities grew in Mesopotamia, they created unprecedented social and economic complexities—the need to track commercial transactions between citizens, calculate agricultural yields, manage storage surpluses, and administer taxes. These urban challenges demanded precise accounting methods that went far beyond simple counting, providing the practical impetus for the development of true mathematics [1].\nThe impact of \\(1\\) on the development of civilization extended even further when it became the unexpected catalyst for one of humanity’s most important inventions—writing. The story of this development again begins with the Sumerians and their counting tokens. Merchants and officials would keep their valuable clay cones in sealed clay bowls for safekeeping, but faced an obvious problem: once sealed, they couldn’t verify the contents without breaking the seal. Their solution was to mark the exterior of the bowls with symbols representing the tokens inside. Over time, they realized the tokens themselves became unnecessary—the exterior markings alone could convey the information. This realization led to the development of cuneiform writing, making \\(1\\) not just the foundation of mathematics but also a key player in the origin of written communication [3].\n\n6. Menninger KW (1992) Number words and number symbols: A cultural history of numbers. Dover Publications\nThe ancient Egyptians developed their own revolutionary application of \\(1\\) that enabled their architectural marvels. While the Sumerians used \\(1\\) conceptually, the Egyptians implemented it physically through standardized measurement. Their “royal cubit”—a precisely measured rod equal to the length from elbow to fingertips plus the width of a palm [6]—became the fundamental unit underlying their monumental architecture. This consistent use of \\(1\\) as a fixed measurement standard allowed the precise engineering evident in the pyramids and temples that continue to awe us today. The Egyptians guarded this standard carefully, maintaining official copies in temples and ensuring its consistent use throughout their kingdom.\nThe Greek mathematician and philosopher Pythagoras1 elevated \\(1\\) from a practical tool to a metaphysical concept. In his philosophical system, \\(1\\) became the monad—the fundamental substance from which all existence flows. His famous declaration that “All is number” reflected his belief in the primacy of numerical relationships in understanding reality. Since all natural numbers are ultimately composed of units of \\(1\\), Pythagoras saw it as the essential building block of both mathematics and the universe itself [5]. This philosophical conception marked a new chapter in humanity’s relationship with numbers, elevating mathematics from practical tool to intellectual pursuit.\n1 Pythagoras (c. 570-495 BCE) was a Greek mathematician and philosopher who had a great influence on Greek and world mathematics and philosophy. His name is associated with one of the most famous mathematical theories of all time, the Pythagorean theorem [7].\n7. Britannica (2023) Pythagoras\n2 Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543) was born in the Kingdom of Poland and is one of the most important figures of the European Renaissance. He is credited with having gone against the geocentric model of the universe and replacing it with the heliocentric model [8].\n8. Britannica (2023) Nicolaus copernicus\n\n9. Seife C (2000) Zero: The biography of a dangerous idea. Penguin Books\nThe development of the Indian numeral system represented both a democratization and temporary diminishment of \\(1\\)’s singular status. This revolutionary system, which we still use today, made \\(1\\) one digit among nine others (1-9), later joined by the equally important \\(0\\). While this might seem to reduce \\(1\\)’s importance, in reality it allowed for far more powerful mathematical operations. The Indian system enabled calculations with previously unimaginable efficiency, leading to breakthroughs in astronomy—including the realization that Earth rotates on its axis and revolves around the sun, a discovery made nearly a thousand years before Copernicus2 [9]. Indian mathematicians also achieved remarkably accurate calculations of Earth’s diameter. These advances were only possible through the collaborative power of \\(1\\) working in concert with its numerical companions.\nThe transmission of Indian mathematics to the Arab world through scholars like Al-Biruni3 [2] and Al-Khwarizmi4 [3] led to further developments, most notably the establishment of algebra as a formal mathematical discipline [5]. When these numerical concepts finally reached Europe, they fueled scientific revolutions—including the confirmation of Earth’s motion around the sun and the development of classical physics [1].\n3 Abu al-Rayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni (973-1048) was born in Khwarazm, a historic region located in Central Asia. He made significant contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and geography, making him one of the most important Islamic polymath scholars [10].\n10. Britannica (2023) Al-biruni\n\n2. Joseph GG (2000) The crest of the peacock: Non-european roots of mathematics. Princeton University Press\n4 Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi (c. 780–c. 850) is also from Khwarazm and is one of the most famous Muslim scholars. He is renowned for laying the foundations of algebra [11].\n11. Britannica (2023) Al-khwarizmi\n\n3. Ifrah G (2000) The universal history of numbers: From prehistory to the invention of the computer.

Oxford University Press\n5 Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) was a German mathematician and philosopher who made many contributions in both fields, the most famous of which was the invention of calculus. Isaac Newton, who also developed calculus, accused Leibniz of plagiarizing his discovery, a charge that remained controversial, but later mathematicians recognized the differences between their versions [12].\n12. Britannica (2023) Gottfried wilhelm leibniz\n6 Isaac Newton (1642-1727) was perhaps the most famous physicist and mathematician of all time and one of the pioneers of the scientific revolution in Europe. He held the presidency of the British Royal Society and made numerous contributions, including the development of calculus with Leibniz and the formulation of the laws of motion and gravity [13].\n13. Britannica (2023) Isaac newton\nThe restoration of \\(1\\)’s special status owes much to Gottfried Leibniz,5 the German mathematician who co-founded calculus with Newton6 [5]. A philosopher as well as mathematician, Leibniz viewed conventional language as inherently flawed—–prone to human error and logical inconsistency. He championed mathematics as the only truly universal language, proposing its use for expressing all rational thought. Though this radical idea initially met with scientific indifference (leading Leibniz to temporarily abandon it), he later found validation in the ancient Chinese I Ching. This text’s depiction of cosmic evolution through opposing dualities—–day and night, male and female—resonated deeply with his thinking [14], reinforcing his conviction that logic could be reduced to binary states.\nThis philosophical breakthrough led Leibniz to develop the binary system using only \\(1\\) and \\(0\\), a stark contrast to the decimal system’s ten digits. Remarkably, this minimal pair could represent any number. The decimal representation of 12 uses place values where one container represents ones (holding 2) and another represents tens (holding 1), combining to make \\(10 + 2 = 12\\).\nThe binary system works differently through powers of two. Four containers represent, from right to left: 2\\(^0\\) (1), 2\\(^1\\) (2), 2\\(^2\\) (4), and 2\\(^3\\) (8). To represent 12, we place one ball in the 8-container, one in the 4-container, and leave the others empty, giving \\(8 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 12\\), which translates to 1100 in binary notation.\nLeibniz recognized this system’s potential for mechanical computation. While he successfully built a decimal calculator, the binary version remained unrealized in his lifetime—a challenge beyond seventeenth-century engineering capabilities [14].\nIn his later years, Leibniz attributed almost mystical significance to the binary system. He saw \\(1\\) as representing divine unity or existence itself, while \\(0\\) symbolized nothingness—the interaction between them mirroring the process of creation [14]. While this metaphysical interpretation may seem fanciful, Leibniz’s practical insights about binary mathematics proved extraordinarily prescient.\nToday, binary code has become the fundamental language underpinning our digital world, exactly as Leibniz foresaw. The simple dichotomy of \\(1\\) and \\(0\\) now encodes everything from financial transactions to personal communications, from scientific data to entertainment media. As we contemplate the possibility that other numerical systems may fade into obsolescence, we witness the ultimate triumph of \\(1\\)—the number that marked humanity’s first steps into mathematics now stands poised to dominate our digital future. From ancient tally marks to quantum bits, the journey of \\(1\\) reflects nothing less than the evolution of human thought itself [14].\n\n\n\n\n14.

I hold a PhD in Biomedical Sciences from the University of Connecticut. My research includes pharmacometric modeling and simulation across various therapeutic areas such as cancer, diabetes, and COVID-19. My work employs diverse techniques including Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP), Physiologically-Based Pharmacokinetics (PBPK), Bayesian inference, and machine learning.\nI am proficient in programming languages such as Julia and R, which I use extensively in my research and modeling work. Beyond my professional expertise, I am deeply interested in the intersection of science, philosophy, and religion, and how these fields can inform and enrich each other. Additionally, I have a strong interest in mathematics, its history, and its profound impact on daily lives and human civilization. I am fascinated by how mathematical principles and numbers shape our world and contribute to solving complex scientific problems.\nI am also an author of both fiction and nonfiction, with two books published in Arabic and currently in the process of publishing them in English. My writing reflects my passion for science and my desire to communicate complex ideas in an accessible and engaging way."

My wife is incredibly supportive and loving, always encouraging me in my pursuits and standing by my side through thick and thin. We share a deep bond and a mutual passion for exploring life’s big questions together.\nVideo game time with my son is also something I cherish. It’s our special way of bonding and having fun, whether we’re teaming up to conquer virtual worlds or just laughing at our in-game mishaps. These moments are priceless and bring a lot of joy to our lives."
