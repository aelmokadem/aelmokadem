As I followed in horrified amazement the progress of the anti-vax‚Äîand more generally the anti-science‚Äîmovement, and how mainstream political figures are pushing the anti-vax narrative, I kept being reminded of Lysenkoism and how these movements are actually the same. The sheer audacity required to reject centuries of scientific progress in favor of YouTube conspiracy theories is truly something to behold. It begs the question: what could possibly motivate people to turn their backs on one of the most significant human advancements in medical history, putting themselves, their loved ones, and their whole communities in harm‚Äôs way for absolutely no reason? Well, I believe I have reached a reasonable, albeit simple, conclusion: stupidity. I‚Äôm not referring to stupidity as the inherent lack of intelligence in individuals‚Äîso no need to take offense! Instead, I‚Äôm discussing stupidity as a social phenomenon, a collective behavior or pattern that emerges in certain contexts. But before I delve deeper into this profound revelation, let‚Äôs first take a quick tour through the history of vaccines and how they have helped humanity. This will provide some perspective on the irrationality of the anti-vax movement."

    "text": "The Historical Progress and Impact of Vaccines\nThe journey of vaccines began with Edward Jenner‚Äôs smallpox vaccine in 1796, which laid the foundation for modern immunology. Jenner‚Äôs groundbreaking discovery demonstrated that exposure to cowpox could confer immunity to smallpox, leading to the development of the first successful vaccine. Fun fact: The word ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù comes from the Latin word for cow, ‚Äúvacca,‚Äù as a tribute to the first cowpox-based vaccine. This concept of inducing immunity through controlled exposure to a pathogen revolutionized medicine and set the stage for future vaccines (Organization 2021; Brunson and Encyclopaedia Britannica 2025).\nThroughout the 19th and 20th centuries, vaccine development advanced rapidly. Louis Pasteur developed vaccines for rabies and anthrax, while the 20th century saw the introduction of vaccines for diseases like diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and tuberculosis. The mid-20th century was a golden era of vaccine breakthroughs, with the polio vaccine developed by Jonas Salk in 1955 and later improved by Albert Sabin‚Äôs oral polio vaccine. These vaccines played a crucial role in nearly eradicating polio globally (Organization 2021; Brunson and Encyclopaedia Britannica 2025).\nTo put this into perspective, global immunization efforts have saved at least 154 million lives over the past 50 years. The measles vaccine alone has saved nearly 94 million lives since 1974. Thanks to the polio vaccine, more than 20 million people are able to walk today who would otherwise have been paralyzed. Smallpox, once a deadly disease that killed 300 million people in the 20th century alone, was eradicated in 1980 due to a successful global vaccination campaign (Organization 2021; Brunson and Encyclopaedia Britannica 2025). Feel free to take a moment to marvel at these numbers, which only a handful of human inventions can rival.\nThen why on Earth did some people choose to steer away from such a successful history?"

    "text": "It Runs Deep\nThe anti-vax sentiment has always gone hand-in-hand with vaccines. A stark example of the manifestation of such sentiment was the formation of the ‚ÄúLondon Society for the Abolition of Compulsory Vaccination‚Äù in the UK in 1880 Figure¬†2. This organization spread misinformation on vaccines, leading to significantly lower vaccination rates, which in turn caused outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases like smallpox (contributors 2025; Durbach 2005).\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî. 2025. ‚ÄòAnti-Vaccine Activism‚Äô. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-vaccine_activism.\n\nDurbach, Nadja. 2005. ‚ÄòBodily Matters: The Anti-Vaccination Movement in England, 1853-1907‚Äô. Duke University Press. https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/book/942/Bodily-MattersThe-Anti-Vaccination-Movement-in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2: ‚ÄúDeath the Vaccinator‚Äù, published by the London Society for the Abolition of Compulsory Vaccination in the late 1800s\n\n\n\nVarious, equally ridiculous, reasons can lead people to fall for the anti-vax trap. These include inherent mistrust in authority and personal beliefs or philosophies. Other, less ridiculous, reasons may include concerns about safety, which can be easily dispelled by any reasonable person, and historical medical scandals, such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study that left a lasting impact on public trust in medical institutions and public health initiatives (Disease Control and Prevention 2025). While I can sympathize with people who were damaged by such experiences to be hesitant of vaccines, I don‚Äôt think an extreme position helps, especially since medical research has undergone many ethical reforms associated with full transparency to stop things like that from ever happening again.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî. 2025. ‚ÄòThe Untreated Syphilis Study at Tuskegee Timeline‚Äô. https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/about/timeline.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm.\n\nTrust, Nuffield. 2025. ‚ÄòVaccination Coverage for Children and Mothers‚Äô. https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/resource/vaccination-coverage-for-children-and-mothers-1#:~:text=Between%202000%20and%202004%2C%20the,%2C%20reaching%2085%25%20in%202023.\nEven with this history of vaccine hesitancy, we still managed to maintain very reasonable global vaccination rates. However, this seems to have changed with the turn of the century. For example, the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccination rates in children in the UK were around 91% between 1994-1997 (Trust 2025). That dropped significantly to about 80% by 2003 (Trust 2025). So, what happened?"

    "text": "The Wakefield Paper: Unveiling the Deception\nAh, the infamous Wakefield paper. In 1998, Andrew Wakefield published a paper in The Lancet claiming a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. This paper was later found to be fraudulent, with Wakefield manipulating data and having undisclosed conflicts of interest (Fiona Godlee and Marcovitch 2011; contributors 2023a).\nLet‚Äôs dive into the juicy details. Wakefield‚Äôs study was based on a whopping sample size of‚Ä¶ twelve children. Yes, you read that right. Twelve. And these weren‚Äôt just any children; they were handpicked to fit his narrative. The study had no control group (children who did not receive the MMR vaccine), relied heavily on parental recall (because memories are always reliable, right?), and linked two common conditions (colitis and autism) without any solid evidence (Fiona Godlee and Marcovitch 2011; contributors 2023a).\nBut wait, there‚Äôs more! Wakefield had financial motives too. He was involved in a lawsuit against vaccine manufacturers and had a patent for a rival vaccine. Talk about a conflict of interest. He even stood to make millions from selling diagnostic kits for a non-existent syndrome he claimed to have discovered.\nAs a result of all this, the paper was retracted in 2010, and Wakefield was stripped of his medical license (Fiona Godlee and Marcovitch 2011; contributors 2023a). Since the release of this bloody paper, numerous studies have been carried out and not one supported its conclusions. On the contrary, all of these papers had the exact opposite conclusion: there is absolutely no correlation between the MMR vaccine and autism!\n\nFiona Godlee, Jane Smith, and Harvey Marcovitch. 2011. ‚ÄòWakefield‚Äôs Article Linking MMR Vaccine and Autism Was Fraudulent‚Äô. BMJ. https://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452.\n\ncontributors, Wikipedia. 2023a. ‚ÄòLancet MMR Autism Fraud‚Äô. Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancet_MMR_autism_fraud.\n\nHviid, Anders, J√∏rgen Vinsl√∏v Hansen, Morten Frisch, and Mads Melbye. 2019. ‚ÄòMeasles, Mumps, Rubella Vaccination and Autism‚Äô. Annals of Internal Medicine 170 (8): 513‚Äì20. https://doi.org/10.7326/M18-2101.\nOne of these studies, published in 2019, was carried out in Denmark (Hviid et al. 2019). This study was one of the largest and most comprehensive studies to investigate the link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Researchers analyzed data from 657,461 children born between 1999 and 2010, following them from age one until August 2013. The study found no increased risk of autism in children who received the MMR vaccine compared to those who did not.\nPretty conclusive, right?! Well, not for anti-vaxxers who had already guzzled the Wakefield Kool-Aid. The damage was done!"

    "section": "Anti-Vax Greatest Hits",
    "text": "Anti-Vax Greatest Hits\nDespite the overwhelming evidence, anti-vaxxers continue to cling to several myths. So, let‚Äôs knock these down one at a time, shall we?\n\nVaccines contain harmful ingredients:\n\nThimerosal: Thimerosal is a mercury-based preservative that was used in some vaccines. However, extensive research has shown that thimerosal is safe and does not cause autism. Moreover, thimerosal has been removed or reduced to trace amounts in all childhood vaccines since 2001 (Disease Control and Prevention 2023b).\nAluminum: Aluminum is used as an adjuvant in vaccines to enhance the immune response. The amount of aluminum in vaccines is minimal and well within safety limits. Studies have shown that the aluminum exposure from vaccines is much lower than what infants receive from their diet (Vaccine Safety 2023).\nFormaldehyde: The amount of formaldehyde in vaccines is much lower than what is naturally found in the human body and is not harmful (Philadelphia 2023a).\n\nToo many shots/antigens in a short time: Some argue that the current vaccine schedule overwhelms a child‚Äôs immune system. However, scientific evidence shows that children‚Äôs immune systems can handle multiple vaccines at once. The number of antigens children are exposed to through vaccines is much lower than what they encounter daily through natural exposure (Disease Control and Prevention 2024).\nNatural Immunity is Better: Some anti-vaxxers argue that natural immunity from contracting a disease is better than vaccine-induced immunity. While natural immunity can be strong, it comes with the risk of severe illness, complications, and even death. Vaccines provide a safe way to develop immunity without these risks (Health 2022).\nVaccines Cause Autoimmune Diseases: There is a claim that vaccines can trigger autoimmune diseases. However, extensive research has shown no link between vaccines and autoimmune diseases. The benefits of vaccination far outweigh the minimal risks (Philadelphia 2023b).\nVaccines Are Not Effective: Some argue that vaccines do not work and that vaccinated individuals still get sick. Tell that to smallpox, which was eradicated thanks to vaccines. No vaccine is 100% effective, but honestly, what is? Seat belts and helmets aren‚Äôt 100% effective either, yet we happily use them because we‚Äôre reasonable people trying to prevent serious injuries, even by a tiny bit. Even if you end up getting sick, vaccines significantly reduce the risk of spreading diseases, supporting herd immunity that helps protect those who cannot be vaccinated (Organization 2021; Brunson and Encyclopaedia Britannica 2025).\nPharmaceutical Companies Profit from Vaccines: There is a belief that vaccines are pushed by pharmaceutical companies for profit. While companies do profit from vaccines, the primary goal of vaccination programs is public health. Vaccines save millions of lives and prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Also, don‚Äôt forget that numerous respectable scientists are involved in the process of vaccine productions. These are just people who have families that they too want to protect, which can only happen if the whole community is well protected by effective and safe vaccines.\nAutism Cases are on the Rise: Anti-vaxxers often point to the rising prevalence of autism as evidence that vaccines are to blame. However, the increase in autism diagnoses is largely due to better awareness, improved diagnostic criteria, and broader definitions of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Disease Control and Prevention 2023a; Statista 2023). In other words, we‚Äôre getting better at recognizing and diagnosing autism, not causing it. As we mentioned earlier, numerous studies have shown no link between vaccines and autism (Clinic 2023). So, while autism diagnoses are indeed on the rise, vaccines are not the culprit.\n\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî. 2023b. ‚ÄòThimerosal in Vaccines‚Äô. https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html.\n\nVaccine Safety, Institute for. 2023. ‚ÄòDo Vaccine Ingredients Cause Adverse Events?‚Äô https://www.vaccinesafety.edu/do-vaccine-ingredients-cause-adverse-events/.\n\nPhiladelphia, Children‚Äôs Hospital of. 2023a. ‚ÄòFormaldehyde in Vaccines‚Äô. https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/formaldehyde.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî. 2024. ‚ÄòMultiple Vaccines at Once‚Äô. https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/multiples.html.\n\nHealth, UCLA. 2022. ‚ÄòNatural Immunity Vs.

    "text": "The Current Impact of the Anti-Vax Movement\nThe anti-vax movement has led to a resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases. For instance, measles cases have spiked globally, with outbreaks in regions where vaccination rates have dropped. The World Health Organization has listed vaccine hesitancy as one of the top threats to global health (World Health Organization 2015).\n\nWorld Health Organization. 2015. ‚ÄòVaccine Hesitancy: A Growing Challenge for Immunization Programmes‚Äô. https://www.who.int/news/item/18-08-2015-vaccine-hesitancy-a-growing-challenge-for-immunization-programmes.\nThe consequences of the anti-vax movement are dire. Unvaccinated individuals are at a higher risk of contracting and spreading diseases, leading to preventable illnesses and deaths. In some areas, previously eradicated diseases are making a comeback, putting vulnerable populations, such as infants and immunocompromised individuals, at risk (World Health Organization 2015)."

    "section": "The Theory of Stupidity: Connecting the Dots",
    "text": "The Theory of Stupidity: Connecting the Dots\nThe ‚ÄúTheory of Stupidity,‚Äù developed by German theologian and philosopher Dietrich Bonhoeffer, provides a framework for understanding the persistence and danger of movements like Lysenkoism and the anti-vax movement. Bonhoeffer argued that stupidity is more dangerous than evil because it can be manipulated and used by evil forces, and it often goes hand-in-hand with power (Thomson 2023; Koblin 2021).\nBonhoeffer‚Äôs theory considers stupidity not just an intellectual deficiency but a sociological problem. He argues that stupidity can spread like a contagion, especially during times of rising power and influence. One key aspect of Bonhoeffer‚Äôs theory is that stupidity is resistant to reason and facts. When confronted with evidence that contradicts their beliefs, people entrenched in stupidity dismiss it outright. This makes them particularly dangerous because they become self-satisfied and hostile when challenged. Sound familiar?\nThe anti-vax movement is a modern manifestation of this principle. It thrives on misinformation, paranoia, and a deep distrust of expertise. Instead of Soviet propaganda, we now have social media algorithms amplifying nonsense at an unprecedented scale. The result? Parents refusing to vaccinate their kids because they believe in medical fairy tales spun by influencers with no medical training. It‚Äôs like Lysenkoism all over again‚Äîexcept this time, instead of Stalinist repression, we have the tyranny of viral stupidity (Thomson 2023; Koblin 2021).\n\nThomson, Jonny. 2023. ‚ÄòBonhoeffer‚Äôs Theory of Stupidity‚Äô. Big Think. https://bigthink.com/thinking/bonhoeffers-theory-stupidity-evil/.\n\nKoblin, Jonas. 2021. ‚ÄòBonhoeffer‚Äôs Theory of Stupidity‚Äô.

    "text": "Conclusion\nLet‚Äôs be clear: the evidence is overwhelming and irrefutable‚Äîvaccines save lives. Yet, despite all the scientific proof, anti-vaxxers cling to their misguided beliefs, putting everyone at risk. If you choose not to vaccinate your child and they end up sick, or worse, dead, that‚Äôs on you. And if your unvaccinated child infects someone else, especially a vulnerable person like an infant or someone with a compromised immune system, then their suffering and potential death are YOUR FAULT. This isn‚Äôt just about personal choice; it‚Äôs about public responsibility. Ignorance and stubbornness in the face of clear evidence aren‚Äôt just foolish‚Äîthey‚Äôre dangerous.\nAnd so, here we are, in a world where medical science has handed us the tools to prevent disease, yet we‚Äôre still battling outbreaks fueled by willful ignorance. If history has taught us anything, it‚Äôs that rejecting science in favor of ideological nonsense always ends in disaster. But hey, at least Lysenko didn‚Äôt have a YouTube channel to amplify his pseudoscience even further."
