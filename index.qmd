## Bio

I am a Pharmacometrician and a Senior Scientist at Metrum Research Group. I hold a PhD in Biomedical Sciences from the University of Connecticut. My research includes numerous publications on pharmacometric modeling and simulation across various therapeutic areas such as cancer, diabetes, and COVID-19. My work employs diverse techniques including Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP), Physiologically-Based Pharmacokinetics (PBPK), Bayesian inference, and machine learning.

I am proficient in programming languages such as Julia and R, which I use extensively in my research and modeling work.

## Key research interests

* **Pharmacometrics**: Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP), physiologically based pharmacokinetics (PBPK), population pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PKPD), Bayesian hierarchical PKPD modeling, merging pharmacometrics with machine learning

## Teaching

I serve as an adjunct professor at both the University of Connecticut and Indiana University
