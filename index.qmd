## Bio

I am a Pharmacometrician and a Senior Scientist at Metrum Research Group. I hold a PhD in Biomedical Sciences from the University of Connecticut. My research includes numerous publications on pharmacometric modeling and simulation across various therapeutic areas such as cancer, diabetes, and COVID-19. My work employs diverse techniques including Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP), Physiologically-Based Pharmacokinetics (PBPK), Bayesian inference, and machine learning.

I am proficient in programming languages such as Julia and R, which I use extensively in my research and modeling work.

I am an active member of the International Society of Pharmacometrics (ISoP) and the American Society of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (ASCPT). I also contribute as a Review Editor for Frontiers in Pharmacology.

## Key research interests

* **Pharmacometrics**: agent-based modelling, disease-avoidant behaviours, epidemics over dynamic networks, geospatial computational epidemiology -- all primarily in the context of infectious diseases

## Teaching

I serve as an adjunct professor at both the University of Connecticut and Indiana University
