There is no bigger question than this. Answering it leads to a cascade of other questions: Why were we created? What is the secret behind the order in the universe? What happens when we die? It's no wonder that human minds have been tirelessly seeking an answer to this question since ancient times.

The quest for a satisfactory answer began with philosophers and contemplative thinking. As human knowledge evolved, we reached the best method so far: science. Naturally, all eyes turned to this confident newcomer to see what it had to say about the existence of God.

Now comes the moment of truth that everyone knows: science has not found direct evidence of God's existence. In fact, we can say that such evidence will never be found. Why? Because one of God's essential characteristics is that He is the creator of the universe, meaning He exists outside of it, beyond time and space. Science has no means to directly test something outside these realms.

But the story doesn't end here. Science doesn't rely solely on direct evidence to prove the existence of things. Many scientific facts are known through indirect evidence. Take the atom, for example. The atom remained a scientific fact for many years through indirect evidence. No one observed an atom directly until 1981 with the invention of the Scanning Tunneling Microscope, and even this method is considered indirect by some.

Another example is black holes, which have such immense gravity that nothing, not even light, can escape their grasp. This property makes it impossible to observe a black hole directly. How can you observe something that is completely dark? Yet, black holes are considered scientific facts because of indirect evidence, such as their gravitational effects on nearby stars or the gravitational waves detected from merging black holes.

So, while the existence of God cannot be proven through direct observation, finding scientific evidence of His existence might be sufficient for proof. These pieces of evidence certainly exist in the vital scientific discoveries we will discuss now.

## The Big Bang

The prevailing view in physics was that the universe was static and eternal, with no beginning or end. This changed in the 20th century when Edwin Hubble measured the redshift of galaxies. To give a quick idea, redshift occurs when light from an object moving away from us shifts to the red end of the spectrum. Conversely, if an object is approaching us, its light shifts to the blue end. Hubble observed that galaxies are moving away from us because their light is redshifted, and the redshift increases with distance. This means galaxies are also moving away from each other. Logical thinking and precise calculations led Hubble to the real meaning of this discovery: if galaxies are moving apart, they must have been closer in the past. Going further back in time, we reach a point where the universe was a single entity called a singularity, about 13.8 billion years ago. From this singularity, the universe began to expand in an event known as the Big Bang [@hubble1929].

What readers might not know is that this idea was proposed by physicist and priest Georges Lemaître in a paper published two years before Hubble's discovery. Remarkably, Lemaître went against the prevailing eternal universe theory, motivated solely by his belief in religious texts stating that God created the universe from nothing. This conviction led him to derive the necessary equations from Einstein's general relativity, making him the true pioneer of the Big Bang theory [@lemaitre1931].

Readers can see how this theory supports the belief in God's existence, leading to the following important conclusions:
1. The theory proves that the universe is not eternal. An eternal universe doesn't necessarily need a creator, but a universe with a beginning does.
2. It confirms what religious texts have stated for centuries without material evidence: the universe has a beginning.
3. If the universe has a beginning, it came from nothing. Scientists have no explanation for what could compel nothingness to produce a universe, except for the intervention of an intelligent, conscious entity. No one imagines, for example, that a fly could suddenly appear from thin air without a higher power, knowing that air is not nothing and a fly is not a universe.

Skeptics of the creator's existence have proposed other explanations for the universe's beginning. One such explanation is the "Big Crunch," where the universe's expansion slows down until gravity overcomes it, causing the universe to collapse back into a singularity, potentially creating a new universe, and so on forever. The problem with this hypothesis is that it lacks strong scientific support, as evidence suggests the universe's expansion is accelerating, not slowing down [@perlmutter1999]. Even if it were true, tracing back through multiple cycles of expansion and collapse would eventually lead to the first singularity that emerged from nothing, bringing us back to the same "cause" problem.

Another theory some consider a better explanation for the universe's beginning is that our universe was created inside a black hole in another universe. While equations might support the possibility of a universe forming inside a black hole, we still ask: what caused the existence of that other universe? Thus, the "cause" problem remains.

An important aspect of the Big Bang theory is, as Stephen Hawking said, "The singularity is where all the known laws of physics break down." Known laws like the first law of thermodynamics and the speed of light, among many others, are violated in the singularity and during the early expansion of the universe. The question then is, how could this happen except through the one who created these laws in the first place?

## Genetic Mechanism

In 1859, Charles Darwin published "On the Origin of Species," laying the foundations for the theory of evolution and the common ancestry of living organisms. Darwin chose natural selection as the mechanism for preserving beneficial traits and eliminating harmful ones, leading to changes in species. However, a lingering problem was: how did the first cell, from which all species came, originate? Natural selection, by definition, requires a mechanism for reproduction, so it cannot be relied upon to create the first cell, which did not come through reproduction [@darwin1859].

The previous question was dismissed by saying the first cell arose randomly, but this was before the molecular exploration of the living cell led to the discovery of the genetic mechanism.

Let's quickly review this mechanism before addressing the challenges it poses to the idea of the random creation of the first cell. We start with the genetic information of living organisms, which determines all their traits. This information is recorded in DNA in the form of a code made up of four letters: A, T, C, and G, which are the four nitrogenous bases of DNA. These bases combine in specific sequences to form genes, which are translated into amino acids. Every three consecutive bases are translated into a specific amino acid out of twenty. For example, the code ATG translates to the amino acid methionine. Based on the sequence of bases in the gene, the corresponding amino acids are translated and linked together to form a protein that performs a specific function. There are proteins responsible for skin color, digestion, eye formation, and so on.

### Returning to Random Creation and Its Challenges in Light of the Genetic Mechanism

According to the genetic mechanism, life is not just about forming the correct nucleic acids or amino acids. These components can be produced randomly, as demonstrated by Stanley Miller's famous experiment in 1953. However, life is essentially about the information encoded in the arrangement of DNA bases and amino acids to form the correct sequence that will function properly. Even a single error in a base or an amino acid can lead to catastrophic results. The natural conclusion is that this information must be encoded by an intelligent entity, much like how we attribute a poem to a smart writer rather than random chance [@miller1953].

To further illustrate the failure of random creation in forming the molecules of a living cell, let's consider a very simple example: a protein 100 amino acids long. Using probability laws, we can calculate the time required to produce such a protein randomly in nature. We find that this time is approximately $10^{234}$ years, far exceeding the age of the universe. Additionally, this random formation would require matter a billion times more than what exists in the universe and a space larger than the universe itself. Thus, the clear result is that random creation cannot explain the formation of even a single protein, let alone a living cell!

Another important aspect revealed by the genetic mechanism, which randomness fails to explain, is the close relationship between DNA and proteins. As mentioned earlier, DNA carries the information needed to produce proteins, and some proteins (enzymes) are necessary to produce more DNA. This means one was made to complement the other. How could this happen randomly? The answer is: it couldn't. This connection between two complex, structurally independent systems requires intelligence.

There have been many attempts to refute the need for an intelligent designer to create life. Perhaps the most significant is the claim that the first molecule created randomly was RNA, not DNA. Recent experiments in 2001 and 2011 have shown that some RNA molecules, in addition to carrying genetic information, can also produce more RNA without the need for proteins, meaning they are self-replicating. This discovery has been used to support the idea of random creation. However, the obvious problem with this proposal is that it requires a very specific type of RNA that "knows" it needs to replicate. Even if it were produced randomly, it would need another similar molecule to produce more of it. Not only that, but this other molecule, also produced randomly, would need to form near the first molecule, and the chances of this happening are extremely small [@joyce2001].

From the above, we see that random creation completely fails to explain life. This means the remaining explanation, which states that life began with intelligent guidance knowing exactly what to do, is undoubtedly the correct one.

## Wave-Particle Duality

Quantum physics, which deals with subatomic particles like atoms and smaller, is perhaps the strangest branch of science. Since its discovery by Max Planck in the early 20th century, it has challenged our understanding of the universe. One of these challenges is the dual nature of particles. Quantum physics tells us that particles have a wave-like nature in addition to being particles.

The experiment that might best illustrate this concept is the double-slit experiment, first conducted by physicist Thomas Young on light. The experiment is simple: a light source is placed in front of a barrier with two small slits, and a screen is used to observe the light after it passes through the slits. The light waves passing through the slits interfere with each other, creating a distinctive pattern of bright and dark bands on the screen. This pattern can only occur if light behaves as waves because if it were particles, we would see just two bright bands corresponding to the slits' positions [@young1804].

When scientists decided to perform the same experiment with particles, the surprising result was that they observed the same interference pattern characteristic of waves. They thought the particles might be colliding with each other as they passed through the slits, so they repeated the experiment, this time firing one particle at a time to prevent any interaction. Yet, the interference pattern persisted. This was sheer madness—the only explanation was that the particle somehow split to pass through both slits simultaneously and then interfered with itself.

Scientists didn't give up on finding the correct explanation. They decided to place a detector to observe the particle as it passed through the slits to see if it indeed split. The surprises continued. They found that the interference pattern disappeared, and the particle behaved like a normal particle, passing through only one slit and leaving just two marks on the screen corresponding to the slits' positions. It was as if the particle had never been a wave. This result puzzled scientists, so they turned off the detector, and the interference pattern reappeared.

After this long scientific journey through the double-slit experiment, it's time to explain the profound implications of these results. First, the wave-like nature of particles is entirely inconsistent with our daily experiences. A particle is something with a specific location at a specific time, while a wave is spread out over multiple locations simultaneously. However, these particles make up the matter in the universe, including our bodies, the Earth, and the Sun. Does this mean that this matter could also be a wave? Quantum physics tells us that this is true.

The other significant result from the previous experiment is that the particle abandoned its wave-like nature and returned to its particle nature when observed. This means that the "observer" is what gives the particle its particle-like properties. Does this mean that matter takes on its particle nature, which we see every day, only because an "observer" is watching it?

This idea didn't sit well with Einstein, who mockingly asked, "Does the moon disappear when I'm not looking at it?"

The truth is that several experiments have proven Einstein wrong in his mockery and that the quantum physics view of reality is indeed the true view. This view can be summarized as "reality does not exist if it is not observed by an observer." However, it's hard for us to accept the idea that if we all looked away from the moon, it would disappear. Therefore, there must be some consciousness that perceives the moon and observes it when no one else does, and indeed perceives the entire universe. Otherwise, the universe would vanish from existence. Doesn't this consciousness seem very similar to God?

## Entropy

Entropy is an important term in physics, representing the degree of randomness or disorder in a system. The second law of thermodynamics tells us that any system always moves from order to disorder, from low entropy to higher entropy, and cannot move in the opposite direction.

To better understand this law, let's use a simple example. If you take the pages of Tolstoy's novel "War and Peace" in order, representing the highest state of order (low entropy), and throw them into the air, do you think they will fall back in the correct order? Of course not. The probability of this happening is one among an enormous number of possibilities where the pages fall in different arrangements. Therefore, the only way to reorder the pages is to intervene and do it yourself, not to wait for it to happen spontaneously.

The principle of increasing entropy is present in everything around us and is never violated. However, if we look at a living cell, this cell is an extremely organized structure. If we accept the idea that this order emerged spontaneously from chaos, we are saying that entropy decreases in this case, which contradicts the rule.

The same can be applied to planets, stars, and galaxies. All these things exist in defiance of the law of entropy because they are organized states. Therefore, they can only exist if work is done to create them, which requires intelligent consciousness.

There is a valid point raised by non-believers on this matter. They argue that entropy in the entire system must always increase, but it may appear to decrease in some parts of the system. Based on this view, the formation of living cells, planets, stars, and galaxies are indeed examples of decreasing entropy. However, since these systems are not isolated from the universe, they are part of the overall cosmic system. The conclusion here is that in other parts of the universe, entropy must have increased to ensure that the total entropy of the universe as a whole is also increasing.

This is a very good point, but the problem is that it cannot be tested. We will never be able to measure the entropy of the entire universe at any given moment, let alone if that moment was billions of years ago.

However, there is another system where entropy decreased without a doubt. This system is the singularity that began the universe through the Big Bang, which we discussed in the previous article. This singularity is the highest model of order in the universe. Since its formation, order in the universe has decreased, and chaos has increased. But the question that puzzled scientists is: how did the singularity with such low entropy form in the first place? The inescapable answer is: through the work of a higher entity.

## The Fine-Tuned Universe

Scientific discoveries have revealed much about the universe, including important cosmic constants. Without these constants, the universe wouldn't exist in its current form, which seems perfectly suited for the emergence of life. Even a slight alteration in some of these constants would have prevented life from developing.

British cosmologist Sir Martin Rees highlights six of these constants in his book "Just Six Numbers" [@rees2000]:

1. **The rate of expansion of the universe after the Big Bang**, which continues to this day. If it were smaller by $1 \times 10^{-17}$, the universe would have collapsed on itself. If it were larger by $1 \times 10^{-6}$, the universe's contents would have dispersed, preventing the formation of stars and galaxies.
   
2. **The density ratio of the universe in different regions**, which is approximately $1:100,000$. This ratio allowed galaxies to form in denser regions. If this ratio were slightly higher, the universe's matter would have turned into black holes, consuming everything. If it were slightly lower, the universe would have remained in a gaseous state.
   
3. **The strength of gravity**, which is fine-tuned to $1:10^{40}$. If gravity were slightly stronger, the universe would be much smaller and would have collapsed before life could form. If it were slightly weaker, the universe would have dispersed, preventing the formation of stars and galaxies.
   
4. **The fusion of hydrogen into helium**, which is the process of energy production in stars. In this process, 0.7% of hydrogen's mass is converted into energy, necessary to bind the components of the resulting helium nucleus. If this percentage were 0.6% instead of 0.7%, hydrogen would be the only element in the universe, preventing the formation of helium and heavier elements, and thus planets. If it were 0.8%, hydrogen would have been exhausted, depleting the universe's energy source.
   
5. **The ratio of the strength of electromagnetic forces to gravity**, which is approximately $1:10^{36}$. If this ratio were different, the universe's lifespan would be much shorter, and living organisms would be much smaller, unable to grow larger than insects.
   
6. **We live in a three-dimensional space**. If it were two-dimensional or four-dimensional, life as we know it wouldn't exist.

Rees's six numbers show that the universe is not only fine-tuned for the emergence of life but also for the development of intelligent, complex life forms like humans [@rees2000].

Rees's numbers are not the only finely-tuned constants necessary for life. There are many others, such as the ratio of matter particles to antimatter particles, where the former exceeds the latter by one part in a billion, and the ratio of the proton's mass to the electron's mass, which is 1836 times greater. These and many other constants confirm the fine-tuning of the universe for life. This astonishing fact led physicist Freeman Dyson to say, "It seems as though the universe knew we were coming" [@dyson1979].

These pieces of evidence didn't deter non-believers, who proposed a theory to explain the "fine-tuned universe." They suggested that our universe is just one among an infinite number of universes, each with different cosmic constants. Our universe happens to have the right values for life to emerge.

This hypothesis is very plausible but has the drawback of being untestable. Any universe other than ours wouldn't send us light, making it unobservable. This means that those who "believe" in this hypothesis based on the fine-tuning argument must admit that they stand on equal footing with those who believe it is evidence of a creator. Neither hypothesis is more scientific than the other. Considering the other evidence we've discussed, the existence of a creator becomes more likely.

After presenting the evidence for God's existence in scientific discoveries, we must address an important idea often raised in discussions with non-believers: the "God of the gaps" argument. This idea suggests that science is not free of gaps, and believers fill these gaps by attributing them to God. Those who adopt this idea are understandable, as this has been the case for a long time and some still do it today. However, if we closely examine the scientific evidence mentioned in this article and the previous one, we find that the issues we discussed are ones where science has given its final word. Science will never discover that the universe had no beginning, or that there is a different genetic mechanism than the one we know now, or that the observer has no role in determining the identity of what is observed, or that the second law of thermodynamics can be broken spontaneously, or that the universe is not as fine-tuned as we thought. Therefore, the "God of the gaps" explanation has no place here.

Some might argue that the previous evidence being merely "indications" without direct confirmation means they have multiple interpretations and that concluding God's existence from these indications is an unjustified leap. I agree with this general principle but reject it concerning the issue of God's existence. The evidence we've discussed leaves no doubt that the universe and life did not come into existence randomly. If we consider alternative explanations to randomness, we find they always point to an intelligent creator, regardless of the names given to these explanations. Readers can test this idea themselves by taking a few minutes to think of an explanation that contradicts it. If they find none, they will have reached the only acceptable conclusion: science indeed proves the existence of God.
