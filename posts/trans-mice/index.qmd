In a recent statement, Donald Trump claimed that the Biden administration spent $8 million on "transgender animal experiments," suggesting that the government is funding efforts to, as he dramatically put it, "make mice transgender." This claim, which sounds like it was ripped straight from the script of a bad sci-fi movie, has predictably sparked outrage and confusion. To make matters worse, Trump’s propaganda arm, previously known as the White House official page, doubled down on the narrative, citing a list of studies under the senational header "Yes, Biden Spent Millions on Transgender Animal Experiments" [@whitehouse_transgender_2025]. But before you grab your pitchforks and torches, let’s take a step back and unpack this absurd claim with the seriousness it deserves (which is to say, not much at all).


## The "Scandal" Explained

Trump’s claim hinges on the idea that the Biden administration has funded experiments to make animals transgender. Cue the outrage, the memes, and the inevitable Fox News segments. But here’s the thing: the truth is far less exciting—and far more scientific—than Trump and his followers would have you believe.

The so-called "transgender animal experiments" are actually research studies focused on understanding the effects of hormone therapies. You know, the kind of therapies used by transgender individuals as part of their medical care. But instead of, say, giving mice tiny little gender-affirming surgeries (which, let’s be honest, would be both ridiculous and logistically impossible), these studies are looking at how hormone treatments impact health conditions like HIV, cancer, and asthma. Shocking, right?


## Breaking Down the "Controversial" Research

Let’s take a closer look at some of these "scandalous" studies, shall we? Spoiler alert: none of them involve mice attending pride parades or coming out as non-binary.

### 1. **HIV Vaccine Responses ($455,000)**  
This study aimed to understand how gender-affirming hormone therapy affects immune responses to HIV vaccines [@nih_hiv_vaccine_2021]. The horror! How dare scientists try to improve healthcare for transgender individuals, who are disproportionately affected by HIV? Next thing you know, they’ll be curing diseases or something equally outrageous.

### 2. **Reproductive Health ($2,500,000)**  
This project investigated the long-term effects of testosterone therapy on reproductive health in transgender men [@nih_reproductive_2021]. Imagine, scientists caring about the health and well-being of an underserved population. The audacity!

### 3. **Breast Cancer Risk ($299,940)**  
This study explored how testosterone therapy impacts breast cancer risk and treatment outcomes [@nih_breast_cancer_2021]. Because, apparently, understanding how to better treat cancer is now a controversial endeavor.

### 4. **Microbiome and Bone Health ($735,113)**  
This research examined how hormone therapy affects the gut microbiome and bone health [@nih_microbiome_2021]. Because nothing says "waste of taxpayer money" like trying to prevent osteoporosis.

### 5. **Reproductive Neuroendocrine Axis ($1,200,000)**  
This study focused on how androgens affect the reproductive neuroendocrine system [@nih_neuroendocrine_2021]. Yes, it’s a mouthful, but no, it’s not about turning mice into drag queens.

### 6. **Asthma Outcomes ($3,100,000)**  
This project investigated how gonadal hormones influence asthma outcomes [@nih_asthma_2021]. Because, as we all know, understanding how hormones affect respiratory health is clearly a gateway to some kind of dystopian mouse utopia.

## The Misinformation Machine

The term "transgender animal experiments" is a masterclass in sensationalism. It’s the kind of phrase that makes you stop scrolling, click the link, and share it with all your friends without actually reading the article. But here’s the thing: these studies aren’t about making animals transgender. They’re about understanding how hormone therapies—which are used by real, live humans—affect the body. 

The idea that scientists are sitting in a lab, twirling their mustaches and cackling as they force mice to transition is, frankly, ridiculous. But hey, why let facts get in the way of a good story?

## Why This Matters

Beyond the absurdity of the claim, this whole "controversy" highlights a bigger issue: the deliberate spread of misinformation to stoke outrage. By framing legitimate scientific research as some kind of bizarre government overreach, critics are not only misrepresenting the facts but also undermining important work that could improve healthcare for millions of people.

And let’s not forget the transphobic undertones of this whole debacle. The implication that studying hormone therapies—which are a lifeline for many transgender individuals—is somehow frivolous or immoral is deeply harmful. It’s a reminder that, for some people, the mere existence of transgender individuals is a threat to their worldview.

## Conclusion: Don’t Believe Everything Trump Says

So, the next time you hear Trump or his allies claiming that the government is funding "transgender animal experiments," take a deep breath and ask yourself: does this sound like something that could actually be happening? Or does it sound like the plot of a bad B-movie? 

The truth is, these studies are about improving healthcare and understanding the effects of hormone therapies. They’re not about turning mice into activists or whatever other nonsense the internet is peddling. But hey, if you’d rather believe in a world where scientists are secretly running a mouse pride parade, who am I to stop you?
