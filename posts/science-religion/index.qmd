Since the dawn of civilization, humans have been driven by curiosity, asking questions like: Where did I come from? What lies beyond the sky? Does my life have a higher purpose? What happens after death? Religion emerged as a comforting messenger, providing many answers to these profound questions.

Philosophy tried to compete with religion as a source of knowledge, but it often raised more questions than it answered. Thus, religion remained the primary source of understanding, especially regarding the mysteries of existence. That is, until a new player entered the arena: science.

Science's unparalleled success in nearly all areas of life earned it widespread respect. However, when science began offering different answers to questions that religion had already addressed, conflict was inevitable.

Throughout history, there have been numerous clashes between science and religion, but a few stand out as particularly significant. Here are the top four:

## 1. Geocentrism vs. Heliocentrism 

The geocentric model, which places Earth at the center of the universe with celestial bodies orbiting it, was widely accepted by ancient Greeks and later refined by Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD. This model was intuitive and aligned with Christian religious texts, making it the dominant view for centuries.

However, in the 16th century, Copernicus proposed the heliocentric model, placing the sun at the center of the solar system. This idea was initially ignored, but gained traction when Galileo's telescopic observations in the 17th century supported it. Galileo's observations of the phases of Venus and the moons of Jupiter provided strong evidence for the heliocentric model. Despite this, Galileo faced the Inquisition and was placed under house arrest for heresy. It wasn't until 1992 that Pope John Paul II formally apologized for the Church's treatment of Galileo [@encyclopedia_geocentrism].

The geocentrism vs. heliocentrism debate marked a significant defeat for religion, highlighting the dangers of literal interpretations of religious texts. Surprisingly, some groups still defend geocentrism, viewing Copernicus' model as a conspiracy against religion [@thisvsthat_geocentrism].

## 2. The Age of the Universe 

While the Bible doesn't explicitly state the age of the universe, religious scholars have attempted to deduce it from biblical events and figures. Estimates varied, but many suggested the universe was less than 10,000 years old.

Classical physics initially posited an eternal universe, but by the 20th century, observations by Edwin Hubble and others indicated that the universe had a beginning, approximately 14 billion years ago. Hubble's discovery of the redshift of galaxies provided evidence for the expanding universe, leading to the Big Bang theory. Radiometric dating further established Earth's age at around 4.5 billion years [@space_age].

These scientific findings challenged the young universe view, leading many religious leaders to reconsider their interpretations. However, a 2009 survey found that 39% of Americans still believed in a young Earth, showing the persistence of this belief [@britannica_age].

## 3. The Great Flood and Noah's Ark 

Many cultures have flood myths, with the story of Noah's Ark being one of the most famous. Some scientists believe these stories may be based on real events, such as a massive flood in the Black Sea region around 5000 BC.

While some evidence supports the occurrence of a significant flood, scientific objections remain regarding the global nature of the flood, genetic diversity, and the survival of species. For instance, the genetic bottleneck that would result from a global flood is not supported by genetic evidence. Additionally, the logistics of housing and caring for all species on a single ark are highly improbable. Thus, the debate between science and religion on this topic remains unresolved [@livescience_flood].

## 4. Evolution 

Perhaps no conflict between science and religion is as intense as the debate over evolution. Since Charles Darwin published "On the Origin of Species" in 1859, the controversy has been relentless. Darwin's theory of natural selection provided a scientific explanation for the diversity of life, challenging the traditional religious view of creation. Interestingly, many religious figures initially saw evolution as evidence of God's greatness, but the loudest voices were those who vehemently opposed it. One notable critic was Bishop Samuel Wilberforce, who famously questioned Darwin's claims in the 1860 Oxford debate.

The opposition to evolution has been fierce, with some religious groups advocating for a young Earth to undermine the time required for evolution to occur. Efforts to ban the teaching of evolution in U.S. public schools led to the famous 1925 Scopes Trial, where biology teacher John Scopes was convicted for teaching evolution against state law. The trial symbolized the clash between science and religion.

In the 1960s, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against state bans on teaching evolution and mandated penalties for teaching creationism alongside it. This was a significant blow to creationists, who then attempted to rebrand creationism as "scientific" to gain legitimacy in education, but these efforts have largely failed.

The debate continues, with a 2014 Gallup poll revealing that 42% of Americans still believe in creationism, while 50% accept evolution (31% believe it is guided by God, and 19% see it as a natural process without divine intervention). These numbers suggest that the conflict over evolution remains unresolved [@britannica_evolution].
