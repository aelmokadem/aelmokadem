## 🎙️ Featured Podcast Appearance: Clinical Pharmacology with Nathan Teuscher Podcast

I recently joined **Nathan Teuscher** on the *Clinical Pharmacology Podcast* for a great conversation about  
**Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP)** and its growing importance in modern drug development.

We discussed:

- What QSP is and why it matters  
- Where it brings the most value in model-informed drug development  
- Common challenges teams face when adopting QSP  
- Practical ways to overcome those challenges  

It was a thoughtful and energizing discussion — big thanks to Nathan for having me on!

## Episode Overview

In this episode, we explore how QSP models can support better decision-making across the drug development lifecycle.

From early discovery through clinical translation, QSP provides a mechanistic framework for integrating biology, pharmacology, and clinical data — helping teams make more confident, model-informed decisions.

Whether you're new to QSP or already working in the space, I hope the discussion offers useful insights into both the opportunities and the realities of implementing these approaches in practice.

### Key Themes Discussed

- The definition and purpose of QSP  
- How mechanistic models support MIDD strategies  
- Communication and alignment challenges across teams  
- Best practices for building impactful QSP programs

If you’re interested in QSP or improving decision-making with modeling, I hope you enjoy the episode.
